After selecting the action from the following menu, for each page, you'll see:

  * The number of page views (PV) since the birth of the page till now
  * The date when the page was last accessed
  * The number of today's PV
  * The number of yesterday's PV
  * The IP address of the visitor who last accessed the page

[NOTE] This tool may handle many log files at a time, so it may take a while to show you the result.

===== Function Menu =====
  * [[?do=admin&page=accscounter&action=mng&mode=existing|Show the log of existing pages]]

  * [[?do=admin&page=accscounter&action=mng&mode=deleted|Show the log of non-existing pages]]
